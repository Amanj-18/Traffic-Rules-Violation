        <h3 id="p1"><b>Maharashtra RTO Fines</b></h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(24, 163, 71);">According to data released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway in November 2019, there were about 13,261 deaths resulting from road fatalities in Maharashtra in 2018. This accounted for an 8.1% increase in the total number of accidental deaths, as compared to 2017. Further, this increase in the number of fatalities put Maharashtra in the second place of the list of states with the highest number of road accident deaths.</p>

        <h3 id="p1"><b>Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act</b></h3>
        <p style="color:rgb(153, 119, 78)">In the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, implemented from 1st September 2019, there were several provisions put forth regarding the safety of pedestrians, non-motorised vehicles and children during a commute, recalling of cars, etc.However, the most significant of changes were brought in regard to the fines imposed for traffic violations. The existing penalties were revised and increased by almost 200%, increasing the liability of vehicle owners and drivers by quite a margin.</p>

        <h3 id="p1"><b>New Traffic Fines</b></h3>
        <p style="color: rgb(50, 189, 189);"> Maharashtra was among those states that denounced the newly introduced traffic fines as unfeasible after taking cognisance of the entire matter. The state, along with several others like Gujarat, Kerala, Karnataka, etc. had subsequently put the implementation of the revised fines on hold, citing the interest of vehicle owners and drivers.But, after putting the implementation of the fines on hold for a while, the Maharashtra traffic fines were finally revised according to the new rates put forth by the amended Act.</p>
